# DESIGNR

Designr is a platform for designers to find the best courses and tutorials in their field with a browser plugin that shares design tips.


## OVERVIEW
In today’s world, people are constantly looking for ways to learn new skills or improve on the skills they already had. The world is transitioning to a point where skills are being prioritized over academic certificates. Therefore, people are looking for easy and affordable means to learn. The global pandemic also heightened the need for digital ways to learn. 
The increased demand for online learning solutions led to the advent of a multitude of online learning platforms. However, this proliferation is a problem in itself, as online learning platforms have an overwhelming amount of information that it becomes burdensome to find what you are looking for. 
As budding designers ourselves, we find that we spend an ample amount of time trying to find specific resources; this takes away from the limited time we have to get the job done. We, therefore, asked ourselves,
“How do we create a platform that curates design resources - courses and tutorials - for designers”?
